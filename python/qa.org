* how can I list a python library(package)'s packages.
a python library, means the pip list showed item.

Fow now, I only find the ${pkg_installed_location}/top_level.txt contains this info.

I write a util pip1 to do this.

* will pyproject.toml and setup.py combine entry_point
No, the reason is for find
