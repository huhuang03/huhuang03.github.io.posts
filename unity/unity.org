* Input
use Input.getAxis("Horizontal") to get horizontal arrow input(can use 'a' and 'd').

* coord
x is right, z is forword.

* Inpsect variable
Just define a variable public.
And you can use ~public GameObject name~ to connect to a game object.

* Materials
I think material is 贴图?

* Prefab

prefab is shortcuts for prefabricated
** create a prefab
Drag and drop from hierency view to project view, create a prefab. And in project view,
I think the blue icon indicate that it's a prefab.

A prefab is also a GameObject, so it can set by inspect view.

** variant prefab
