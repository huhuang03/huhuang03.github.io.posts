After update path in system advance setting gui.

Need rebot computer to apply that change.

* reload without restart

Fuck this powerhsell

$env:path is the old path


%path% in cmd is right path

# is ok, but when the nwe inserted variable contains env, don't work
$Env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine") + ";" + [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","User")
