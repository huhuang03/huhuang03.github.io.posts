Recodrd upgrade powershell 5.1.18362.1474 to the latest v7.1.3

I don't think that I can uninstall the default powershell, because it's in ~%SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe~

Accoding to [[https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-powershell-10-can-i-delete-it/e4f0b2c7-1190-4f09-bd29-ff012e2f2d5c][this link]] seems I can uninstall the default powershell 1.0.

Actually I can't find uninstall.exe in ~%SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe~. So I can't uninstall the powershell 1.0.


But I can change the terminal setting, add the powershell7 as the default.

Next question: How can I version all my personal settings, or simply says that sync in computers.
