I will try use docker(ubuntu 14.04) to build this.

I have a u-disk which I want put aosp source code, and mount in docker.

I decide use ntfs fs. It can be used in windows, linux(natively), mac(need some setting).

Ok, let's try


* File transfer window to docker
test.txt windows

- copy to docker with `docker copy` command

Now the text.txt is 777 mode.

Now I have no idea how to do this.


exfat doesn't support permission?
