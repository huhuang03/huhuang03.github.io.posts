This post we will build opencv with qt.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cd cv_source
mkdir build
# this will throw error, please see below
cmake -DWITH_QT=ON  -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF  ..
# on windows. use --config Release
cmake --build . --config Release
# error is below
cmake --instlal .
#+END_SRC


** can't find qt5conf.cmake
#+BEGIN_SRC 
CMake Error at cmake/OpenCVFindLibsGUI.cmake:18 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Qt5" with any of
  the following names:

    Qt5Config.cmake
    qt5-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Qt5" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "Qt5_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Qt5" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
#+END_SRC

To resolve:
- download the vcpkg
- run vcpkg install qt5. Will install FindQt.cmake in ~vcpkg_path\packages\qt5-base_x86-windows\share\cmake\Qt5~
- now we set Qt5_DIR in env pointer to the folder.
  Now we can use the ~WITH_QT~
