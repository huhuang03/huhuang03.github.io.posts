find_package has two mode, first is the module mode, and second is the config mode, config mode as the fallback mode.

What find_package do?

Can I use this to find my own package??


Let's anylysis the demo find package opencv

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake
set(OpenCV_DIR "D:\\Program Files\\opencv\\build")
find_package( OpenCV REQUIRED )
#+END_SRC

As the link1 says, cmake search for FindOpencv.cmake file in ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH}.
Acooding to the link1, cmake find fail back to config mode.
But it can't find. So you must specify the OpenCV_DIR at where cmake can find OpenCVConfig.cmake.

* the four build type
  relase debug x x32 x64 = 4 different type libs.

  So how find_package() handle the 4 different.

  Yes, let's first see how the vcpkg handle this.
