What find_package do?

Can I use this to find my own package??


Let's anylysis the demo find package opencv

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake
set(OpenCV_DIR "D:\\Program Files\\opencv\\build")
find_package( OpenCV REQUIRED )
#+END_SRC

As the link1 says, cmake search for FindOpencv.cmake file in ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH}.
Acooding to the link1, cmake find fail back to config mode.
But it can't find. So you must specify the OpenCV_DIR at where cmake can find OpenCVConfig.cmake.
