I have an package with source named foo. And I run cmake --install . in foo.
Then It will install some lib, cmake_config, include in X:/Program Files(x86)/foo/lib[include]/ folder.

Then I want use it. What need I do is let cmake find it. Like this?
#+BEGIN_SRC cmake
find_package(foo REQUIRED)
#+END_SRC

Should it work? Let try it.

Awesome. We didn't need any extra confit to let cmake the foo installed package!






	// why p??
	// p = dest0_ + (dest1 - dest0_) / 2;
	// q = p;
