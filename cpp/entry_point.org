In elf, there a pointer ~e_entry~ to an entry point function. So how this function defined?

* User define
You can custom this entry, like this:
#+begin_src cpp
extern "C" void testEntry() {
  // do nothing!!
}

#+end_src

and compile with:

#+begin_comment
g++ --entry=testEntry -shared -o test_entry.so test.cc
#+end_comment


* use default

The defualt in my case is named ~deregister_tm_clones~. I think it's append by gcc compiler. refer this link:
