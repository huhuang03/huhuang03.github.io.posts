When go from 2 to 3. 3 size up, but 2 is empty, show look like nothing happend. when go 4. 4 size up, let 3 go up.

Oppesite. When go from 4 to 3. the 3 size up, let 3 go down.

# The key is when onWillAccept at index 3 (start at 2), the widget should go up is 2. So increment 3 size is right.

# 相反的
# When start at 4. onWillAccept at index3.
