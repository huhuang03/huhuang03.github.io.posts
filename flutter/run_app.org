runApp analysis:

#+BEGIN_SRC dart
void runApp(Widget app) {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()
    ..scheduleAttachRootWidget(app)
    ..scheduleWarmUpFrame();
}
#+END_SRC


* WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()
  Will initial other binding.


So what is a binding? I think it set the window calballs, so it can communicate with window.
