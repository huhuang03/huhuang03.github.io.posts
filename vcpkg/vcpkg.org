* How vcpkg install pkg. And how we set the path?
** use vcpkg search qt to find the qt.
** use vcpkg install qt5 to install qt5. But where did it installed?
*** vcpkg/packages is the package vcpkg installed, orgnized by package.
*** vpckg/installed is a better place to include or link, like linux libs, incluces directory.
****  vcpkg/installed/x64-windows and vcpkg/installed/x86-windows. Can smart choice by cmake? Doubt.
     And uneder the folder, theres a share folder, where the cmake file lives.

So how can I set the path? To x64-windows directly for now.
