The error is:

Mixture of designated and non-designated initializers in the same initializer list is a C99 extension

And occuse in some code like this:

#+begin_src c++
struct Foo {
  int i;
  int j;
} Foo;


void foo() {
  Foo foo = {1, j = 2};
}
#+end_src


for gcc c++11, it's ok, but msvc cl complian like this:

#+begin_quote
mixed is not support
#+end_quote

So let's figure out how to resolve this.


The standard is here: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Designated-Inits.html
