we seem many times the warnning: ~The resultion 0 dpi in invalid. use 70 instead.~

So what's the ~resolution~ means. 

And if it's the mean of ~pixel per unit~. Why it exist in image info??

Yes, a resouliton is the ~pixel per unit~. And the image meta may have this value if it present some visual, like take from camere(I Guess).


So I don't know the what's the best resolution set for a image. So use the defualt 70??
